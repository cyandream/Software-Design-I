This project is to be used as a set of example questions about basic Java functionality.

Currently, the classes contain a Main method, a constructor with some System.out.println(...) calls, and methods.
The Main method merely calls the constructor.
The constructor calls the methods in the class, and prints their output.
Each method contains different statements which return a value in the end.

The best way to use these classes is to go through each piece of code, come up with an answer, then run the methods
one by one to make sure your answers are correct.
